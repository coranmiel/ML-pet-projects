# Machine Learning Pet Projects

My repository is dedicated to exploring the field of Machine Learning. This page will serve as a collection of my pet projects (playing around :)), showcasing the concepts I've learned along the way.

One day there'll be a lot of projects, but for now...

## Existing Projects

### 1. **Implementing K-means Algorithm for Image Compression**
   - Basics of K-means Algorithm
   - Demonstrates how to use the K-means clustering algorithm to compress images dy reducing the number of colors

I plan to update this repository with new material as I continue to learn and experiment!
